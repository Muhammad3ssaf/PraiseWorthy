For: Osman  Saeday
Date: 2023-05-04

To: Graduate Admissions Committee

I am writing this letter to recommend my former student Osman  Saeday who is applying 
for the Master of Science (MS) in your school. 

I met Osman  in Fall when he enrolled in my "CS166: Information Security"
course. 

Osman  earned "A" from this tough course, and this shows how
knowledgeable and hard worker he is. 

He also earned  "A" from my "CS166: Information Security", "B" from my "CS154: Theory of Computation" and "C" from my "CS160: Software Engineering"

Osman  has submitted well-written assignments and participated in all of my class activities.

He was always very passionate and very enthusiastic.

Furthermore, I noticed from the term project result, he developed leadership, time 
management, and problem-solving skills. He worked effectively with the team members and 
delegated tasks appropriately. They were able to deliver a successful project in a timely fashion.

I believe that Osman  has the capacity to excel at higher education program and this 
is my pleasure to highly recommend him. 

Please do not hesitate to contact me with further questions.


Very Respectfully,
